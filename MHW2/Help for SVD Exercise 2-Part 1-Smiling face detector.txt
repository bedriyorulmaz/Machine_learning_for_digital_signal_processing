% Some help for "SVD Exercise 2-Part 1: Smiling face detector":

% Following code gives a possible answer for the final classification section.
%This code calculates the average distance of each smiling face projection vector to the smiling class and to the neutral class. 
The decision is made based on these two average distances. 


% Use the coefficients of these projections to classify each smiling face
